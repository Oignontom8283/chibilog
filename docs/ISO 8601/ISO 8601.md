# ISO 8601 Standard

The [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) is a standard from the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (ISO) that specifies the numerical representation of dates and times, based on the Gregorian calendar and the 24-hour time system.

## Date and Time Representation
The date and time are represented as follows when aiming for the highest possible precision:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS,ss-/+FF:ff
```

## Example (NodeJS ISO Date)
```
2025-03-21T22:44:53.042Z
```

## Breakdown of the Components
- "YYYY" represents the year in four digits (e.g., 1959);
- "MM" represents the month in two digits (e.g., 12 for December);
- "DD" represents the day of the month in two digits (e.g., 25 for the 25th day of the month);
- "T" separates the date (on the left) from the time (on the right);
- "HH" represents the hour in the 24-hour system (e.g., 15);
- "MM" represents the minutes (e.g., 20);
- "SS" represents the seconds (e.g., 49);
- "ss" represents the fractional seconds, with as many units as necessary (e.g., 3342);
- "-/+" indicates the time zone, where "+" represents a time zone ahead of UTC and "-" represents a time zone behind UTC;
- "FF" represents the number of hours ahead or behind UTC;
- "ff" represents the number of minutes ahead or behind UTC.
